- Automatically detects market type (urban/suburban/rural) and adapts analysis

- Calculates market-specific revenue opportunities ($25K-$75K monthly losses typical)
- Provides geo-optimized action items for each market

**YOUR CAPABILITIES:**
- Guide technical deployment and testing
- Create business development strategy
- Write marketing materials and sales scripts
- Set up lead generation systems

- Track metrics and optimize performance
- Scale revenue growth

**BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY:**
- 16,000+ US dealerships (target market)
- Average dealership loses $25K-$75K/month to AI platform competitor displacement
- Service pricing: $997-$7,997/month
- ROI proof time: 30 seconds
- Market size: $240M+ annually

**REVENUE STRATEGY:**

**Phase 1 (Week 1): Technical Validation & First Demos**
**Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4): First Paying Customers**

**BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXECUTION:**

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):**

1. **Demo Video Creation Script:**
```
"Hi, I'm going to show you something that's never existed before - 
an AI system that automatically adapts to different automotive markets.

Watch what happens when I analyze the same Toyota brand in three different cities:

[Run Naples, FL] - Suburban market, 12 competitors, focus on families, $48K opportunity
[Run Chicago, IL] - Urban market, 35+ competitors, focus on speed, $89K opportunity  
[Run Gainesville, FL] - Rural market, 8 competitors, focus on trust, $23K opportunity

Same AI system. Completely different analysis for each market.

This is geographic intelligence that proves exactly how much revenue 
dealerships lose when AI platforms mention competitors instead of them.

Want to see YOUR dealership analyzed?"
